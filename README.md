## Information about claiming
Information about claiming and other FAQ can be found on [Discords blog](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/19822382831767-1-Month-Discord-Nitro-for-Opera-GX-Users-2023-Promo-FAQ). One key thing to take out of it is you can only claim it if you haven't had nitro before within the last 12 months.

I highly recommend you watch this video by NoTextToSpeech to find out more on how this exploit takes place:

## Disclaimer
This promotion will be ending on **December 16th, 2023 (3PM PST) to June 17th, 2024 (11:59PM PST).**

Also, once claimed Discord *will* automatically renew you're subscription every month. So to stop that from happening, go to your Discord settings, go to `Subscriptions` and on the nitro banner click cancel. Cancel this and you nitro will remain present until it expires and you will not get charged next month.
